               <p>
We all love to travel, but nobody wants to get stuck in a large bus tour or a boat trip with dozens of other tourists. We believe that personalized tours and smaller groups culminate into a more intimate travel experience. Small and unobstructive numbers get you privileged access to beautiful farms and wine-tasting destinations in South Africa. Besides, you get to be on a first-name basis with both the tour guides and your fellow travellers.

      <p>They say the best trips are unplanned, which is why we always leave room for one or two spontaneous detours along the road. Our registered tour guides anticipate your needs and plan ahead so you can have more freedom to choose the places you want to visit.
